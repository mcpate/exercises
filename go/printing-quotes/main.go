/*
Challenge:
Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes
we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.
Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author
as shown in the example output.

Example Output: What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

Constraints:
- Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.

My notes:
- No requirements for blank entries OR quoted strings, so assuming fine.

	fmt.Println(author + " says, \"" + quote + "\"")
